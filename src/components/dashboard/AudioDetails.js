          <h4>Acousticness:</h4>
          <p>
            A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is
            acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic. The
            distribution of values for this feature look like this: Acousticness

        <div className="audio-detail">
          <h4>Danceability:</h4>
          <p>
            Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on
            a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability,
            beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least
            danceable and 1.0 is most danceable. The distribution of values for
            this feature look like this: Danceability distribution

          <h4>Energy:</h4>
          <p>
            Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual
            measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel
            fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy,
            while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features
            contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived
            loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. The distribution
            of values for this feature look like this: Energy distribution
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="audio-detail">
          <h4>Instrumentalness:</h4>
          <p>
            Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds
            are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word
            tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is
            to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content.
            Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but
            confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0. The distribution
            of values for this feature look like this: Instrumentalness

          <h4>Liveness:</h4>
          <p>
            Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher
            liveness values represent an increased probability that the track
            was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood
            that the track is live. The distribution of values for this feature
            look like this: Liveness distribution
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="audio-detail">
          <h4>Loudness:</h4>
          <p>
            The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values
            are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing
            relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that
            is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength
            (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db. The
            distribution of values for this feature look like this: Loudness
            distribution

        </div>
        <div className="audio-detail">
          <h4>Speechiness:</h4>
          <p>
            Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The
            more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio
            book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above
            0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken
            words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain
            both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such
            cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music
            and other non-speech-like tracks. The distribution of values for
            this feature look like this: Speechiness distribution
          </p>

        <div className="audio-detail">
          <h4>Valence:</h4>
          <p>
            A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness
            conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive
            (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence
            sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). The distribution
            of values for this feature look like this: Valence distribution
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="audio-detail">
          <h4>Tempo:</h4>
          <p>
            The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In
            musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and
            derives directly from the average beat duration. The distribution of
            values for this feature look like this: Tempo distribution
